# Innovative Smart Glass using Metaheuristic Based Gradient-Free Optimization technique

## Introduction:
Smart glasses offer great potential for aiding visually impaired individuals, but often overwhelm users with excessive information. Our research addresses this issue through the development of an optimizerâ€”a sophisticated system integrated into smart glasses. By leveraging real-time streaming protocol (RTSM) and cutting-edge deep learning technologies like You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) for object detection and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) for natural language processing, our optimizer filters irrelevant information, prioritizing essential navigational cues for users.

## Problem Statement:
Visually impaired individuals often struggle with information overload when using smart glasses for navigation. Our aim is to develop a user-centered design that focuses on crucial cues while eliminating unnecessary information.

## Approach:
Our solution integrates a multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based optimizer into smart glasses. The hardware configuration includes an Arduino Uno-based CPU, ESP8266 Wi-Fi module for real-time updates, and a CMOS OV7670 Camera Module for image capture. Additionally, an A9G Board with XIAO-ESP32 C3 facilitates emergency SOS functionality. YOLOv8 and LLaMA enhance object detection and natural language processing capabilities, respectively.

## Usage:
1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect components as per provided diagrams.
2. **Software Configuration**: Utilize Arduino IDE for coding modules and customize hyperparameters for YOLOv8.
3. **Integration**: Implement PSO-based optimizer and LLaMA for intelligent filtering and natural language understanding.
4. **Customization**: Users can adjust confidence levels to prioritize information according to individual preferences.
5. **Deployment**: Utilize TorchScript for mobile deployment and Django Rest Framework (DRF) for building WebAPIs.

## Key Features:
1. **Intelligent Filtering**: Prioritizes crucial navigational signals and objects in real-time.
2. **Enhanced Suggestions**: Utilizes databases and GPS data to provide intelligent suggestions on nearby points of interest.
3. **Customizable Priorities**: Users can adjust confidence levels to tailor information to their preferences.

## Conclusion:
Our Smart Glasses Optimizer represents a significant advancement in aiding visually impaired individuals, offering a streamlined and intelligent navigation experience. By combining cutting-edge technology with user-centric design, we strive to enhance accessibility and independence for all users.
