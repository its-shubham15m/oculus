## Introduction:
Smart glasses offer great potential for aiding visually impaired individuals, but often overwhelm users with excessive information. Our research addresses this issue through the development of an optimizerâ€”a sophisticated system integrated into smart glasses. By leveraging real-time streaming protocol (RTSM) and cutting-edge deep learning technologies like You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) for object detection and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) for natural language processing, our optimizer filters irrelevant information, prioritizing essential navigational cues for users.

## Approach:
Our solution integrates a multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based optimizer into smart glasses. The hardware configuration includes an Arduino Uno-based CPU, ESP8266 Wi-Fi module for real-time updates, and a CMOS OV7670 Camera Module for image capture. Additionally, an A9G Board with XIAO-ESP32 C3 facilitates emergency SOS functionality. YOLOv8 and LLaMA enhance object detection and natural language processing capabilities, respectively.
